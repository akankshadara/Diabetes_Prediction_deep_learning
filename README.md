# Diabetes_Prediction_deep_learning
This repository contains code used for prediction of diabetes on the Pima Indiana Diabetes dataset using neural networks.


# OBJECTIVE: 
A neural networks model will be developed using Python and would involve loading of dataset, defining a neural networks model in Keras, compiling the model using efficient numerical backend, training the model on data and evaluating it to compute its accuracy.


# APPLICATION:
The database of Prima Indian diabetes comprises of certain attributes such as glucose concentration, diastolic pressure etc. which are very adequate for Diabetes Mellitus diagnosis.
